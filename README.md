# AHK-Horizontal-Scroll
Simple AutoHotKey script that allow you to scroll horizontally when you hold Shift Key and scroll

How To Use?
1. You have to install AutoHotKey from [AutoHotKey Official Website](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. Download **Scroll.ahk** from this repo
3. Run it and done~

I found this useful when certain software does not support horizontal scrolling (I cannot scroll horizontally in MS OneNote with Shift Key + Scroll)
